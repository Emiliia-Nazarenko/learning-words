# Learning words

This application is a help for learning foreign words. First, you write words to the database. During training, a word will appear in one window, and in another you must enter its translation. If the number of correct answers reaches 5, then you are given the translation of the word and you must enter the word itself. As soon as the number of correct answers reaches 5 again, this word is moved to the archive. It is possible to view which words are in the database, in the archive and at what level of the attempts.
